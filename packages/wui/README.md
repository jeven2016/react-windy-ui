Wui web framework
-------------------------------
This is a web UI framework like bootstrap , semantic UI,
we design it with some personal reasons and hope it looks cool to implement a modern web site.


for demo, currently the documentation hasn't finished yet, an alternative is by referring to the following samples:

##Wui components<br/>
